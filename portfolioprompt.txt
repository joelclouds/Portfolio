Professional statement outline

To develop a professional statement that brie

y explains who you are and what you are

passionate about, follow the steps outlined.
Note: You will need a piece of paper or a blank word processing document to complete this
activity
Step one
List two to three strengths that you currently have or are commi

ed to developing (e.g.,

strong wri

en and verbal communication, time management, programming, etc.).

Having an inventory of your strengths can help you create your professional statement. It may
also encourage you to focus on skills you want to develop as you progress through the
certi
cate program.
Step two
List one to two values you have (e.g., protecting organizations, protecting people, adhering
to laws, ensuring equitable access, etc.).
Establishing your values can help you and a prospective employer determine if your goals are
aligned. Ensure that you are representing yourself accurately, and be honest about what
motivates you.
Step three
Ask yourself some clarifying questions to determine what to include in your professional
statement:
1. What most interests me about the

eld of cybersecurity?

2. Who is the audience for my professional statement (e.g., cybersecurity recruiters,
speci
c organizations, government employers, etc.)?

3. In what ways can my strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity support the
security goals of various organizations?
